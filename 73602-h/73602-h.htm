  <h2 class='c004'>THE OWL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, dear Tom!” said Grace, in a low
voice to her brother, “here we have sat
as still as mice for such a long time.
I am so tired!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us go into the hall, then,” said
Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But will not mamma’s friends think
us rude to leave the room?” said Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I dare say not,” said Tom;
“but I will go and ask mamma.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Mrs. Moore gave them leave to do
as they wished, and Tom and Grace
were soon in the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, Grace,” said her brother,
as he led her to the glass-door which
looked on to the lawn, “what say you
to a race down the broad path, and
back through the nut-walk?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, thank you,” said she, as she
drew back; “it is so dark in the nut-walk,
I do not wish to go near it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will not be dark now,” said
Tom: “see how brightly the moon
shines! why I could see to read by its
light.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Grace looked up, and saw that dark
clouds were rising, and would soon
pass over the moon, and then all would
be dark again; but she strove to hide
her fears, and said, as she took Tom’s
hand, “Come, then, let us go; but
you will not run away and leave me,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, dear Grace, that I will
not,” said Tom: “now then, one, two,
three, and away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the broad walk, they
stood still to take breath. Grace cast
her eyes into the thick shade of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>trees and shrubs, and saw no cause for
fear; but as the wind blew through the
leaves and branches, she could fancy
she heard voices, first on her right hand,
and then on her left. As she had
feared, the moon was now quite hid by
clouds, and the pale light of the stars
could not shine through the gloom of
the nut-walk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pray let us go now, Tom,” said
Grace, as she clung to him. “Why do
you stand so still? Hark! what <i>is</i> that
noise? Oh, Tom, pray come home;
there it is again!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>“Dear Grace,” said Tom, “do not
fear, it is only a bird; let us stay a
short time, and perhaps we may see it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,” said Grace, “it must be a
great ugly bird, to make such a noise
as that, and I do not wish to see it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it is not very great or very
ugly,” said Tom; “and I know you
will want to see it, when I tell you that
it is an owl; and I dare say it is the
same that Smith told me of, which has
its nest in the old oak.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, is it?” said Grace: “there it
is again, Hoot! hoot! hoot!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“Hush,” said Tom; “come a step
or two this way: now look, do not you
see him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where?” said Grace, “on that
bare branch of the yew? O dear! I
never saw such a bird before: what a
large round head he has!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And look at his beak,” said Tom,
“in the shape of a hook, that is for
him to tear his prey with. There, that
cloud has blown over, and we can see
him well. He is quite brisk now: I
should like to see him dart on a bird or
a mouse.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“O dear! I never saw such a bird before: what a large round head he has!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“I should not,” said Grace; “for
though it is no worse than for us to
eat cows and sheep, yet his sharp
claws must hurt them so much, and
I could not bear to hear them squeak.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I,” said Tom. “Well, the
old man has flown away now, so we
had better go home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you ever see an owl before,
Tom?” said Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, once, a long while ago, when
I was at play in the wood. I was
going to hide in the trunk of an old
tree, but when I put my head in, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>heard such a noise, and looking up, I
saw a large owl: he flapped his wings,
and looked so fierce, that I ran away;
and mamma told me a great deal about
owls, when I got home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must not run over the lawn,
Tom,” said Grace, “for the dew is so
thick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, here we are at the door, quite
safe,” said Tom: “now you will not be
afraid when you hear an owl hoot
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no,” said Grace, “I shall not,
indeed.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>JOHN GRANT’S RETURN FROM SEA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At a small farm-house, a long way
from any large town, lived an old man
and his wife, whose names were James
and Kate Grant. They had had five
sons, who were now all grown up, and
had left their home to earn their own
bread. One had gone to sea, but had
not been heard of for four or five years,
so that it was thought he must be
dead.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>It was a cold bleak night; the wind
was high, and the snow beat against
the front of the old house. As James
and his wife sat by their snug and warm
fire-side, they thought how glad they
ought to be for such a nice home, and
that they should thank their good God
for His care of them in their old age.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not so strong as I was,” said
James, “for I feel that a little work tires
me now; and though Ned Brown is a
good boy, yet he is too young to be of
much use to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah,” said Kate, with a deep sigh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“it seems hard that we, who have had
five boys, should now be left all alone
with none to help us: if one of them
would but come and live here I should
feel quite young once more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is our poor John?” said
the old man, as tears rose in his eyes.
“Oh that I had not let him go to sea!
What a night is this for those on shipboard!
May they be kept from harm!
Put a fresh log on the fire, good wife,
for it is very cold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my poor boy!” said Kate,
“shall I ever see him again? He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the best child of them all: how could
I let him go from home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We did it for the best at the time,”
said James, “and it will not bring him
back to mourn over him now. Dear
me! what can make the dog bark in
that strange way?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dare say,” said Kate, “he does
not like to hear the wind howl in the
old trees: hark! how the boughs
creak! When first you and I came to
live here, those trees were young and
in their prime, but now I think they
will not stand much longer than we
shall.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Oh, yes,” said the old man, “they
are not quite so near their end as we
are, my dear; but I do not like to
hear Lion keep up such a noise; it
cannot be all right, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>James Grant got up from his armchair,
and went to the door; but he
could hear no noise, nor could he see
anything, for the snow beat right in his
face. Just as he came back, he heard
his wife call out, that she saw a man
look through the window at her; and
in great fear she begged James not to
go out.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Why should I care?” said he:
“I have done no harm, and it may
be some one who has lost his way in
the dark, and who is in want of help.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words he put on his hat,
and with a stout stick in his hand, to
use in case of need, he went out.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not gone far, ere the man he
was in search of came up to him, and
begged a place to sleep in that night,
as it was a long way to the next
town.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must speak to my wife,” said
James; “and if she likes to do so, I
dare say she can give you a bed. Come
in, for you are cold and wet.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“As she said this, she looked in the man’s face, and saw that his eyes were full of tears.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>The man did as he was bid, took off his
thick coat, which was quite white with
snow, and went to the fire. As Kate
set a chair for him, she saw that he had
on a short blue jacket, such as her John
wore when he came home from his first
trip to sea. The sight of this, and the
man’s honest face, quite won her heart;
and she soon set before him some bread
and cheese, and a mug of warm beer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come,” said James, when he was
once more in his seat, “I am glad to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>see you here, for this is a lone place,
and it does one good to see a new face
now and then. Wife, have you not got
any meat to give our friend?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not want more, thank you,”
said the man: “you have lived in this
old house a long while, have you not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, yes, we have,” said James;
“it is near fifty years since we first
came. Pray have you been here before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can you ask?” said Kate,
“such an out-of-the-way place as it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I used to know it quite well, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>I was a boy: I lived not far from here,
then,” said the seaman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There now, wife,” said James.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lived near here!” said Kate:
“why when you were a boy, there
could not have been a house within
three miles of this: pray what was your
name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you by and by,” said the
man: “but can you tell me where
Charles and Ned Grant are gone? I
used to play with them when we were
young, and I love them very much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Charles and Ned Grant!” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>both the old folks at once, “why who
should they be but our own boys!
they have left us a long while now.
Charles went a long way off, where he
could get more work than in this land;
and Ned lives at a farm of his own, and
has a wife and child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had a son John, who went
to sea, had you not?” said the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, and a dear son he was:
when you came in you put me so in
mind of him,” said Kate; “but we
fear he must be dead now, for he never
writes to us or comes to see us.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>As she said this, she looked in the
man’s face, and saw that his eyes were
full of tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My mother! my dear mother!”
said he, as he got up and threw his
arms round her neck. “And now your
lost son has come home, and will not
leave you, but will take care of you,
and work for you all his life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Poor James and his wife were so
full of joy, that they could not speak
for some time; but they thanked God
in their hearts, for having brought their
dear son home to them to cheer their
old age.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><span class='sc'>LITTLE FRANK and the RAT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One fine spring day Mrs. Dean set
out for a walk. She crossed the lawn
at the back of the house, and chose a
long path, which had thick shrubs on
each side, and led her to the gate of a
field.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one end of this field there was a
small pond of clear water; on its banks
grew long grass and rushes, and the
little birds sang their sweet songs in
the lime-trees that hung over the water.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i030.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“What a droll thing! I shall like to watch you all the more now I know something about you.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>As Mrs. Dean came near to the spot,
she saw her little boy there. He sat
quite still on the edge of the pond.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Frank, my dear,” said she, “why
do you sit there? it is too damp a
place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, mamma,” said Frank, “do come
and see this droll sight! Look on the
other side; just by that old stump of a
tree is a large water-rat. I have seen
him a long time, and I think he wants
to dig a hole in the bank: if I go near
to look at him, he jumps into the pond.
Is he going to make a place to live in?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Yes, my dear,” said Mrs. Dean, “he
will dig a deep place in the earth, to
serve him for a nest; and I dare say he
will make two holes to creep in and
out of, one higher than the other, in
case the water should rise above one
of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does the rat eat the small fishes or
worms, mamma?” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my dear, it feeds on the soft
roots of plants, which it finds in the
water, or in the damp parts of the
fields. It is not so fierce as the landrat,
and its fur is more soft and close.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>When it hears a noise, it leaps into the
water, and dives down in fear; but it
cannot stay long there for want of air,
so it rises again, and just puts its nose
above the water, that it may be able to
breathe and yet not be seen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a droll thing!” said Frank:
“I shall like to watch you all the more
now I know something about you.
Good-bye, little busy rat, for to-day.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><span class='sc'>FRANK and a FIELD-MOUSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A few days after Frank had seen the
rat at work on the bank of the pond,
he was at play in the fields with his
pet dog. He saw Dash scratch up the
ground and smell about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, Dash! Dash!” said Frank;
“what are you doing?”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Frank was a kind boy, and would not let Dash run after it.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Just then a small brown mouse
came out of his hole, and ran away
very fast. Frank was a kind boy,
and would not let Dash run after it and
kill it, as he wished. He held his dog
tight, and sat down near the spot, to
see if the mouse would come back; but
as it did not, he ran in-doors to tell his
mamma what he had seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was such a nice little mouse,
mamma, with a very long tail; and it
ran away at a great rate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my dear,” said Mrs. Dean,
“the field-mouse is very quick and
can leap well. It does much harm
in the fields and gardens, and to the
ricks of corn, and is often found in
farm-yards. Owls, kites, dogs, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>cats make war against the poor field-mouse,
and I fear that men do so too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor thing!” said Frank; “I am sure
I would not kill one, for I like to see
them run in and out of their holes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In its nest in the ground,” said Mrs.
Dean, “or under a bunch of moss, it
hoards up its store of food before the
cold days come: sometimes it finds out
the holes which the mole has left, and
lives in them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How sly,” said Frank, “not to
make a place of his own! Thank you,
dear mamma, for this tale about him.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A TRUE TALE<br> <span class='fss'>OF A</span><br> <span class='large'>LITTLE GIRL WHO FELL INTO A TAN-PIT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Now I will tell you a tale about a little
girl, whom we will call Anne Grey,
though that was not her real name.
Anne was very fond of her doll, for
she had no little boys or girls of her
own age to play with.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like some other dolls, I know, (and
some little girls too,) its clothes were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>apt to get dirty, and Anne thought it
would be great fun to put Miss Dolly
to bed for the day, while she washed
them up. Well, once, when the
maids were busy in the wash-house,
Anne thought it just the right time for
her to begin, so she set to work in great
glee. When all the clothes were nice
and clean, she went to the garden to
look for a place where she could hang
them up to dry. She soon found one
to suit her; tied up a line, and went
back to the house for the things.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her way to and from the garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>led through a tan-yard, and the busy
little girl, in her haste to push by the
edge of one of the pits, fell splash in,
with all her doll’s clean clothes in her
hand. What was to be done now?
there she was, up to her chin in the
nasty brown water, and she could not
get out. Old Mrs. Bigg, who was at
work just by, heard the poor child cry,
and ran to help her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, do pray take me out,” said
she; “I will not do so any more!”</p>

<p class='c007'>So she was soon pulled out, and put
into a tub of warm water, for which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>you may be sure, there was much need.
It was a long time ere poor Anne ran
so fast through the tan-yard again.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE USEFUL DOG.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One day, as Tom Price was on his
way to school, with his bag of books
at his back, he stood still to look
at a fine large dog which lay in the
sun before the door of a poor man’s
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take care how you go near that
fierce dog,” said the gruff voice of a
man who passed by just then.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think he will hurt me,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>said Tom, “if I do no harm: see, he
lets me pat his head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The dog got up, and seemed to like
Tom to stroke him; but as soon as he
saw the man, he gave a low growl, and
looked quite fierce.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, you see I told you right,”
said the man, as he made haste away.
Just then the master of the dog came
out, and sat on a bench by the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you please,” said Tom, “what
makes the dog growl at that man who
went by, while he seems so fond of
me?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“I will tell you,” said he; “he
knows that that is a bad man; for one
day he got over my hedge, and stole
some fruit; but the dog caught him,
and would not let him go till I went
out to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a good guard he must be!”
said Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said the man, “and I can tell
you more than that; for one day a little
girl who was at play near the millstream,
fell in, and might have been
drowned, had not I and my dog been
near and heard her screams.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Did the dog jump in?” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and he swam down the stream
after her, and brought her safe to land.
She was soon quite well; and the dog
and she are now such great friends, it
is quite droll to see them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must run away now,” said Tom,
“for it is my school-time. When I am
a man I hope I shall have such a dog
of my own.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>What does make little Charles Ross
run so fast across that long field? he
looks as though he had a great deal to
tell. Yes, see, there is his aunt Lucy,
not far off; he will soon catch her, I
think. There, now he has got up to
her; but he is so out of breath he cannot
speak just yet. Aunt Lucy says
something to him, let us go near and
hear what it is.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“My dear boy, you should not run
so fast this hot day. Pray where have
you been all this time, and what have
you seen?”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i049.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“I aimed so well that the cap struck him, and made him drop his prey.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Oh, aunt!” says Charles, “as soon as
I came from school, I went to the farmyard
to feed my fowls; and it was very
well I did, for what should I see but a
cruel hawk pounce down in the midst of
my poor chicks: the old hen flew at him,
and pecked him well with her beak, and
shook her wings at him, but he was too
bold to care for that; so I gave a loud
shout, and flung my cap at him, just as
he flew off with the white chick in his
claws. I aimed so well, that the cap
struck him, and made him drop his
prey: I then ran to it, but the poor
thing was quite dead, and its nice white
down was all dyed with blood. Do
you know, dear aunt, I felt so vexed
that the tears came into my eyes; but
then I thought I must not be angry
with the hawk, for God made it, and
had taught it what sort of food to take
home to its young ones.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now see how pleased aunt Lucy looks,
and how she kisses Charles, and says, “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>am very glad to hear you speak so, my
own dear boy, and to see that you
thought of what I told you a day or
two ago, that the wise and good God
has made all things well, and that He
cannot err in any of His works.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>GEORGE AND ROSE’S LONG WALK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Come,” said George King, a boy of
five years old, to his sister Rose, “come
and play on the grass-plat with me. I
will lend you my new ball.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes,” said Rose, as she put
down her doll, “that I will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a short time they were tired of
play; and Rose said to George, “Let
us go and see aunt Jane, we both know
the way quite well.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“It is such a long walk,” said George,
“and I think there will not be time
before it grows dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes there will;” said Rose, “and
I dare say aunt Jane will send us home
in the chaise.” So she took George’s
hand, and led him into the lane, for
though she was not so old as he was,
she often made him do as she pleased.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the way was long, and the sun
was low in the sky, but George and
Rose thought no more of that. They
went on over two or three fields, till
they came to a high gate.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Now, then,” said George, “we
must climb this, for I find it will not
open;” so he was soon on the other
side. But Rose was so short she could
not even get to the top rail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, what are we to do?” cried she.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, if you cannot get over,
Rose,” said George, “we must go
back, for there is no way but this to
reach aunt Jane’s house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh dear, oh dear!” said Rose,
“why we are so near to it, I can
see the roof through the trees.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot help it,” said George;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“we must not stay here, for it will
soon be dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am so tired!” said poor Rose,
with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not think of that now,” said
George, as he got off the top of the
gate on which he had sat to rest, “for
we have a long way to go back, and
must make haste;” so, hand-in-hand,
they set off.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a short time they met a man that
knew them well: “Ah, go home, go
home,” said he, as he shook his stick
at them; “they are all in a great fright
about you.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Poor George and Rose ran as fast
as they could, for they now thought
they had done wrong to leave home.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as they got to the door,
Rose ran up to her grandmamma,
and said, as tears ran down her cheeks,
“It was all my fault, <i>that</i> it was; for
George did not wish to go, but I led
him out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said George, “it was my
fault too, for I knew it was wrong,
and Rose did not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said their kind grandmamma,
as she kissed them and dried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>their eyes, “you will not do so any
more, I dare say, now that you feel
that you are too young to go out alone.
But it is high time you were in bed, so
run up stairs to Ann, like a good boy
and girl.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE GLOW-WORM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As John and Mary Green were on
their way home from their aunt’s house,
where they had spent the day, they
saw something bright in the grass by
the road-side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look, look! what is that?” said
John to the maid.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I dare say it is a drop of dew
which shines in the light of the moon,”
said she.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Oh, no,” said Mary, “the moon
does not shine through that thick hedge
at all: let me try to pick it up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here it is,” cried John, “I have
got hold of it; but it does not shine
now: this cannot be it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not drop it,” said Mary; “but
take it home to mamma, and she will
tell us what it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They now made all the haste they
could: they found their mamma at the
hall-door, who was looking out for
them, and told her what they had
brought.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Oh, I dare say it is a glow-worm,”
said she: “let me look at it:
yes, that it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A glow-worm! mamma,” said John
and Mary, “what is that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a small worm, which is able
to send forth a light from its body,
which shines in the dark, as you
saw it. This is the only insect of the
kind which is found in our isle, but
there are many in other lands, and
some of them give far more light than
this does. There is the fire-fly, which,
as it flits in and out of the dark bushes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>in the night with its star-like light,
must look very pretty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, how I wish I could see it!”
said John.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The men who live where the fireflies
are, sometimes use them as a lamp,
to guide them from place to place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How droll,” said Mary, “when
you want a light, just to run into the
woods and catch one!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How many things there are in the
world,” said John, “which I have not
heard of!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said his mamma, “that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>quite true; and though you should live
to be an old man, you will still have to
say the same, for the earth and the sea
are full of the works of the Lord, and
no life is too long in which to learn
them all.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE REED-BIRD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“James, James, where are you gone?”
said Jesse Wright.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, Jesse, here I am, quite
safe,” said James. “Pray do not
make such a noise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you found there?” said
Jesse, as she spied him out deep in the
thick rushes. “Shall I come to you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no,” said James, “that you
must not: I shall soon get out, and
then I will tell you what I have seen.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“What can it be?” thought Jesse.</p>

<p class='c007'>While James is making his way out,
let me tell you what sort of a place it was
where he and Jesse were. There was
a flat field, or marsh, through the midst
of which ran a small clear brook; tall
grass and rushes grew thick and close
over this marsh, and many trees marked
the course of the stream. Jesse was
on the edge of the marsh when first she
lost sight of James, who had heard the
chirp of a bird which was new to him,
and had crawled into the sedge to look
from whence it came.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Well,” said Jesse, “so here you
are at last. What a mess you are in!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not care for that,” said James,
“for I have seen something worth a
sight, and it was the first of the kind I
ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make haste and say what it was,”
said Jesse: “was it alive?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, to be sure,” said he.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought,” said Jesse, “that only
frogs and toads lived in the marsh.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you thought wrong,” said
James: “but if you can be still, I will tell
you what it was. While I stood here with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>you I heard such a strange chirp, and as
I did not know what bird’s note it was,
I thought I would try and find the nest,
(not to touch it or take the eggs, of
course, but just to have a look at it.)
So I crept in very still, and went to
the place from whence the sound came.
In a short time I was close to it, and
there I saw such a sweet little nest! it
was made of the dead leaves of the
rush and sedge, and a few pieces of
dry grass, and lined with the soft tops
of the reed. And, oh, Jesse! I
wish you could have seen the eggs;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>there were six of them, white, with
small red spots all over; such tiny
things! On the stem of a reed, close
by the nest, was the hen-bird, and her
mate was not far off; but the noise you
made drove them away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not mean to do harm, dear
James,” said Jesse. “I wish I had
been with you, I would have been very
still then. But what is the name of the
bird?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, it must be the reed-bird,”
said James, “for I have seen a print
of one, and this was just like it; and
I have read of it too. It eats the seeds
of the reed, and young snails, and
flies.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i069.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“On the stem of a reed, close by the nest, was the hen-bird.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“How large is it, James?” said
Jesse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is quite a small bird; but from
its thick coat, and long tail and legs,
looks as large as a red-breast. Its bill
is very small.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh dear,” said Jesse, “did you
feel that? was it not a drop of rain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that it was,” said James,
“and a large drop, too: I think it will
soon pour. Come, we must run home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>fast, or that dark cloud will catch us.”
So they set off, and just reached their
papa’s door in time.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A TALE OF THE NORTH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Shut the door, Hugh, and bring your
stool to the fire-side, and I will tell you
a tale. What sort of a one must it be?”
said Mrs. Stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, dear mamma; a tale
of the north, if you please; that cold
place, where there is so much snow and
ice. I like to hear of that, when I am
snug and warm by the fire; and I feel
so glad I do not live there.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“And perhaps those whose home is
in that cold land, would not change
their lot with yours. They love their
close, round huts, their rough benches,
their furs and sledges, as much as we
do our nice house and fire-side, our
chairs and rugs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do tell me more of them!” said
Hugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are a small race of men, not
more than four or five feet high, with
dark faces, deep-sunk eyes, and straight
black hair. In the warm days they
live on the fruits of the chace, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>winter on the dried flesh of the rein-deer,
salt-fish, and cheese. You know
I once told you what a long, dark winter
theirs is, when the sun is not seen
for many days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, mamma,” said Hugh, “and it
must be very dull for them, poor things.
But will you tell me about the rein-deer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, I do not know what they
would do if they had not such a friend
as the rein-deer proves to them: from
it they get both milk, food, and warm
clothes. It feeds on a moss, of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>there is a great deal there; and though
the snow may lie very thick upon the
ground, the rein-deer can tell where
his food grows, and with his fore-feet
and broad horns he digs through the
snow to get a meal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, mamma, how can he find it
out?” said Hugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The quick sense of smell with
which the rein-deer is gifted, leads him
to the right spot, and he is never known
to search in vain. The men yoke them
to their sledges, which glide over the
smooth, hard snow at a great rate.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“What sort of a thing is a sledge,
mamma?” said Hugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is made of birch-wood, something
in the shape of a boat, about six
feet long, with a high back; and here,
wrapt up in his thick furs, the man sits
as snug as can be. They drive with a
cord tied to the horns of the rein-deer,
which flies over the ground at great
speed, with his light load. If you will
bring me that large book from the shelf
I can show you the print of one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I see it,” said Hugh, as his
mamma turned over the leaves; “that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>is a nice thing to ride in. But look
at that man, he is so wrapt up in
furs, I can only see his eyes. What a
droll cap he wears! and see, mamma,
the rein-deer has such a gay thing
round his neck, with a bell hung in
front; pray is that for use or show?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have read,” said Mrs. Stone,
“that the rein-deer likes the sound of
a bell; and also, when four or five
sledges travel at once, in the dark, or
in a snow-storm, it helps to keep them
all in one track.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“It is of no use to make roads there,
for the snow would quite hide them,
would it not, mamma?” said Hugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my dear, the sun and the stars
guide them in the way they wish to go;
but I cannot talk to you more now, for
I must write a note to your aunt, before
post-time. You may try to draw
the sledge and rein-deer in your new
book, if you please; but you must take
great pains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, that I will, for I should
like to draw that much, to show papa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>when he comes home,” said Hugh, as
he took his stool to his mamma’s side,
that she might look at his work now
and then.</p>
